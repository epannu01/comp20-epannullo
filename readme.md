1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

The purpose of this Git repository is to house all of the completed projects and work that was done over the course of Comp20: Web Programming. It can be referenced at any time in the future to be used as examples, and can also be used to showcase work that I have accomplished all in one place. It can be easily accessed, is organized into folders by project, and can also be updated / worked on in the future.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was the MBTA assignment. I enjoyed being able to understand and use APIs as well as style the page to look nice and to have live information updates. I also enjoyed it because it solved a real life problem that many people would benefit from. I thought this was a powerful lab because it taught us how to use things that we encounter in daily life all of the time. I often use the T and find it useful that I now know how to program a map with schedule data.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I had some knowledge of web programming before coming into comp20, but I think I have grown a lot since starting this course. I believe that I have a much better big picture understanding of how the web works, how things are connected, and what all of the moving pieces are. I also have learned that the web is much more complicated, ever growing and changing, and that much web dev is abstracted away from us. 

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

> It is important to format data exactly the correct way. For example, when passing data from the 2048 server from assignemtn 3 to the server we wrote, the information needed to be passed using a querey string or else it would result in an error.

> We need to learn how much we can actually complete in an alloted time frame- we are learning this while working on our semester group project. There comes a time where you have to scope down a project in order to complete it. 


5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

Being an electrical engineer, I found the networking side of things to be very interesting. I would like to learn more about how different systems actually communicate with each other, how communication errors are handeled, etc.
