Status Report 1
1) This week, we were able to implement putting the videos on our website and some
styling while also working on getting our search functionality working.
2) Wrestling with the youtube api and finding times when we were all free to work were
challenging.
3) Our goals for next week is to get the input working for the website so that, when
you type into a search bar, 10 videos that are the most popular related to that content
will appear on the page. We will also begin to implement the rating system that will
either move liked videos to the top and will remove disliked videos.
